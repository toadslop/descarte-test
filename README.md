# Time Machine Test
To complete the test, I wrote two files.
`main.js` runs the test.
Logic for the Deck is contained in the Deck class located in `Deck.js`.

For explanations, please refer to the commends in each file.

Use the commands below to run the test file.
With the `--with-logging` flag you can log the output of each iteration.

**Run command:** `node main.mjs`
**Run with logging:** `node main.mjs --with-logging`

_Note_: I believe the test specification is in error. It provides three iterations: the original deck, then what it says are the first and the second. However, it actually presents the first and the third iterations.
